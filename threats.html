    <h2>Threats to the Bay and Sound</h2>
    <p>Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound are ecologically rich complexes of coastal and marine habitats. Beaches,
        wetlands
        and offshore waters are home to plant and animal communities that include commercially valuable species of
        finfish
        and shellfish, marine mammals, sea turtles and birds.
        Cape Cod Bay is part of the much larger Gulf of Maine system that contains some of the world’s most productive
        waters. While strong tides move water around in the Bay, it can take about a month for a full exchange of water
        to
        occur. Nantucket Sound is located at a confluence of the cold Gulf of Maine and the warm Gulf Stream. It is
        protected from the Atlantic Ocean by Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket Islands, and is shallower than the Bay.</p>

    <p>Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound were designated as state ocean sanctuaries more than 40 years ago to “prohibit
        activities that may significantly alter or endanger the ecology or appearance of the ocean, seabed or subsoil.”
        This
        designation recognized the vitality and importance of the Bay’s and the Sound’s resources to the state.</p>

    <h3>Pollution</h3>
    <p>From a distance both Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound appear healthy. However, according to the Cape Cod
        Commission,
        “Cape Cod has a water problem. The saltwater border that has defined our peninsula is being poisoned by
        nitrogen.
        About 80% of the nitrogen that enters Cape Cod’s watersheds is from septic systems. The conditions it creates
        destroy animal habitat and result in frequent violations of water quality standards indicated in part by fish
        kills
        and diminished shellfisheries.” The impacts of this pollution need to be closely monitored.</p>
    <p>Polluted runoff is another major problem impacting our coastal waters. This type of pollution is a result of
        contaminants picked up in rainwater and melting snow which are eventually emptied into the bay. Examples of
        possible
        pollutants picked up in runoff include fertilizers and other lawn/garden chemicals, wastes from pets, salt from
        roadways, and oil and gasoline leaked from automobiles. In many towns on the Cape this problem is compounded by
        the
        large parking lots located near or directly adjacent to harbors. Not only are the oil and gasoline associated
        with
        parked automobiles a problem, but these large parking lots are often the site of the disposal of snow (and the
        associated salt used to treat the roads) cleared from roads during the winter.</p>
    <h3>Eutrophication</h3>
    <p>The consequences of pollution have already manifested in our coastal waters. In addition to the direct, toxic
        effects of pollution, excessive nutrient input from both point and nonpoint sources leads to high levels of
        plant
        growth. This process, known as eutrophication, is occurring to some degree in Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound
        and
        more noticeably in the coastal ponds and embayments that discharge into them. Eutrophication has been linked to
        a
        number of different harmful processes in coastal waters. Two symptoms of eutrophication that have been
        extensively
        documented are harmful algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia.</p>

    <h3>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)</h3>
    <p>Algal blooms occur primarily during the spring and summer in our coastal waters. During the spring, Phaeocystis
        blooms occur frequently in Cape Cod Bay. The negative impacts of a bloom of this phytoplankton are far reaching,
        affecting the entire food chain by out-competing other beneficial species of phytoplankton (Roberts 2003, Tang
        2003), affecting zooplankton growth and production (Tang 2001, Turner et al. 2002), and being a nuisance to
        feeding
        right whales (Kelly et al. 1998). A more well-known species of phytoplankton resulting in HABs is Alexandrium
        sp.,
        one of the species behind the phenomenon of red tides. Red tides have been linked to the deaths of fish, whales,
        and
        humans (Anderson 1994, Bushaw-Neston & Sellner 1999). Blooms of this species vary greatly from year to year. Due
        to
        its lifecycle of dormant cysts, Alexandrium blooms are likely to become a repetitive occurrence if conditions
        remain
        conducive, i.e. high nutrient input, stratification (Mcgillicuddy et al. 2003). Although there have been no
        documented deaths as a result of the recent blooms that have occurred in the Bay or the Sound, the effects are
        still
        felt by the loss of income of commercial fishermen from shellfish bed closures and impacts on conch
        fisheries.</p>
    <h3>Hypoxia</h3>
    <p>Closer inshore, the negative impacts of pollution are evident in the sediments. Sediments in and around harbors
        such
        as Rock Harbor and Wellfleet Harbor, which were once sandy, are now composed primarily of a silty, dark mud. If
        disturbed, these sediments release a distinct sulfurous odor indicative of areas of low oxygen. This odor comes
        from
        the production of hydrogen sulfide by bacteria which reside in low oxygen (hypoxic) sediments. Since most
        organisms
        are stressed by low oxygen levels, hypoxic waters are usually devoid of most life. While motile organisms such
        as
        fish can leave these areas, benthic organisms will be killed. Portions of the estuaries discharging into
        Nantucket
        Sound, for example the Three Bays complex in Barnstable, also have oxygen-depleted sediments. This had occurred
        in
        areas of Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, giving these areas the name “dead zones.” Although areas of low
        oxygen in the coastal waters of Cape Cod are not nearly as extensive as observed in these locations, these areas
        need to be monitored and remedied before the problem progresses.</p>
    <h3>Habitat Destruction</h3>
    <P>One of the most important, yet least studied habitats in our coastal waters are the eelgrass ecosystems. Eelgrass
        (Zostera marina) in Nantucket Sound is found predominately in the nearshore waters from Monomoy west to
        Hyannisport
        and the shore of Falmouth. It is found more extensively in shallow areas of Cape Cod Bay, along most of the
        shoreline and out on Billingsgate Shoal. In both the Bay and the Sound, eelgrass is fundamental in structuring
        the
        resident flora and fauna. Eelgrass systems are highly productive and extremely important biologically. They act
        as a
        refuge and nursery for juvenile fish and shellfish, many of which are commercially important species in this
        region
        and typically support a higher diversity and abundance of marine life compared to surrounding unvegetated areas
        (Heck et al. 1989). Seagrasses are equally important from a purely physical perspective in that they help to
        prevent
        erosion by stabilizing sediments with their extensive root systems as well as aid in filtering contaminants from
        the
        water column.</P>
    <p>Despite the obvious value of seagrass ecosystems, eelgrass beds in the Bay and the Sound are threatened by a
        number
        of anthropogenic perturbations. Declines in eelgrass habitat have been linked to physical disturbances (i.e.,
        dredging, construction, shellfishing, propeller damage from boating), turbidity (i.e. topsoil runoff, activities
        that re-suspend sediments), and pollution (including eutrophication). There is evidence of the destruction off
        eelgrass habitats in the Bay and the Sound by all of these mechanisms making the health of this already fragile
        ecosystem even more tenuous.</p>
    <h3>Overexploitation</h3>
    <p>This region of Massachusetts was given the name of Cape Cod because of its abundance of codfish. Today these fish
        have virtually disappeared from the waters of the Bay. Other species found in the Bay and Sound, such as
        flounder,
        tautaug, sea bass, and striped bass have likewise suffered from overexploitation.
        With reference to some commercial shellfish species, overexploitation is tied directly to habitat destruction.
        The
        development of different methods of fishing to increase the catch of a declining stock has been disruptive.
        Hydraulic pumping for sea clams was once outlawed in the Bay. Over the past several decades, however, it has
        been
        re-implemented in an attempt to increase the harvesting of these clams.</p>
