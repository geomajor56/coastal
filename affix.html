            <p> Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound are ecologically rich complexes of coastal and marine habitats.
                Beaches,
                wetlands and offshore waters are home to plant and animal communities that include commercially valuable
                species of finfish and shellfish, marine mammals, sea turtles and birds.
                Cape Cod Bay is part of the much larger Gulf of Maine system that contains some of the world's most
                productive waters. While strong
                tides move water around in the Bay, it can take about a month for a full
                exchange of water to occur. Nantucket Sound is located at a confluence of the cold Gulf of Maine and the
                warm Gulf Stream. It is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Islands,
                and is shallower than the Bay. </p>


            <p>Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound were designated as state ocean sanctuaries more than 40 years ago to
                "prohibit activities that may significantly alter or endanger the ecology or appearance of the ocean,
                seabed or subsoil." This designation recognized the vitality and importance of the Bay's and the Sound's
                resources to the state.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="pollution">Pollution</h2>
            <p>From a distance both Cape Cod Bay and Nantucket Sound appear healthy. However, according to the Cape Cod
                Commission, "Cape Cod has a water problem. The saltwater border that has defined our peninsula is being
                poisoned by nitrogen. About 80% of the nitrogen that enters Cape Cod's watersheds is from septic
                systems. The conditions it creates destroy animal habitat and result in frequent violations of water
                quality standards indicated in part by fish kills and diminished shell fisheries." The impacts of this
                pollution need to be closely monitored.</p>
            <p>Polluted runoff is another major problem impacting our coastal waters. This type of pollution is a result
                of contaminants picked up in rainwater and melting snow which are eventually emptied into the bay.
                Examples of possible pollutants picked up in runoff include fertilizers and other lawn/garden chemicals,
                wastes from pets, salt from roadways, and oil and gasoline leaked from automobiles. In many towns on the
                Cape this problem is compounded by the large parking lots located near or directly adjacent to harbors.
                Not only are the oil and gasoline associated with parked automobiles a problem, but these large parking
                lots are often the site of the disposal of snow (and the associated salt used to treat the roads)
                cleared from roads during the winter.</p>

            <h2 id="eutrophication">Eutrophication</h2>
            <p>The consequences of pollution have already manifested in our coastal waters. In addition to the direct,
                toxic effects of pollution, excessive nutrient input from both point and nonpoint sources leads to high
                levels of plant growth. This process, known as eutrophication, is occurring to some degree in Cape Cod
                Bay and Nantucket Sound and more noticeably in the coastal ponds and embayments that discharge into
                them. Eutrophication has been linked to a number of different harmful processes in coastal waters. Two
                symptoms of eutrophication that have been extensively documented are harmful algal blooms (HABs) and
                hypoxia.</p>

            <p>Algal blooms occur primarily during the spring and summer in our coastal waters. During the spring,
                <em>Phaeocystis</em> blooms occur frequently in Cape Cod Bay. The negative impacts of a bloom of this
                phytoplankton are far reaching, affecting the entire food chain by out-competing other beneficial
                species of phytoplankton (Roberts 2003, Tang 2003), affecting zooplankton growth and production (Tang
                2001, Turner et al. 2002), and being a nuisance to feeding right whales (Kelly et al. 1998). A more
                well-known species of phytoplankton resulting in HABs is <em>Alexandrium</em> sp., one of the species
                behind the phenomenon of red tides. Red tides have been linked to the deaths of fish, whales, and humans
                (Anderson
                1994, Bushaw-Neston & Sellner 1999). Blooms of this species vary greatly from year to year. Due to its
                lifecycle of dormant cysts, <em>Alexandrium</em> blooms are likely to become a repetitive occurrence if
                conditions remain conducive, i.e. high nutrient input, stratification (Mcgillicuddy et al. 2003).
                Although there have been no documented deaths as a result of the recent blooms that have occurred in the
                Bay or the Sound, the effects are still felt by the loss of income of commercial fishermen from
                shellfish bed closures and impacts on conch fisheries. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="hypoxia">Hypoxia</h2>
            <p>Closer inshore, the negative impacts of pollution are evident in the sediments. Sediments in and around
                harbors such as Rock Harbor and Wellfleet Harbor, which were once sandy, are now composed primarily of a
                silty, dark mud. If disturbed, these sediments release a distinct sulfurous odor indicative of areas of
                low oxygen. This odor comes from the production of hydrogen sulfide by bacteria which reside in low
                oxygen (hypoxic) sediments. Since most organisms are stressed by low oxygen levels, hypoxic waters are
                usually devoid of most life. While motile organisms such as fish can leave these areas, benthic
                organisms will be killed. Portions of the estuaries discharging into Nantucket Sound, for example the
                Three Bays complex in Barnstable, also have oxygen-depleted sediments. This had occurred in areas of
                Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, giving these areas the name “dead zones.” Although areas of low
                oxygen in the coastal waters of Cape Cod are not nearly as extensive as observed in these locations,
                these areas need to be monitored and remedied before the problem progresses.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="habitat">Habitat Destruction</h2>
            <p>One of the most important, yet least studied habitats in our coastal waters are the eelgrass ecosystems.
                Eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) in Nantucket Sound is found predominately in the nearshore waters
                from Monomoy
                west to Hyannisport and the shore of Falmouth. It is found more extensively in shallow areas of Cape Cod
                Bay, along most of the shoreline and out on Billingsgate Shoal. In both the Bay and the Sound, eelgrass
                is fundamental in structuring the resident flora and fauna. Eelgrass systems are highly productive and
                extremely important biologically. They act as a refuge and nursery for juvenile fish and shellfish, many
                of which are commercially important species in this region and typically support a higher diversity and
                abundance of marine life compared to surrounding unvegetated areas (Heck et al. 1989). Seagrasses are
                equally important from a purely physical perspective in that they help to prevent erosion by stabilizing
                sediments with their extensive root systems as well as aid in filtering contaminants from the water
                column.</p>
            <p>Despite the obvious value of seagrass ecosystems, eelgrass beds in the Bay and the Sound are threatened
                by a number of anthropogenic perturbations. Declines in eelgrass habitat have been linked to physical
                disturbances (i.e., dredging, construction, shellfishing, propeller damage from boating), turbidity
                (i.e. topsoil runoff, activities that re-suspend sediments), and pollution (including eutrophication).
                There is evidence of the destruction off eelgrass habitats in the Bay and the Sound by all of these
                mechanisms making the health of this already fragile ecosystem even more tenuous.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="exploit">Overexploitation</h2>
            <p>This region of Massachusetts was given the name of Cape Cod because of its abundance of codfish. Today
                these fish have virtually disappeared from the waters of the Bay. Other species found in the Bay and
                Sound, such as flounder, tautaug, sea bass, and striped bass have likewise suffered from
                overexploitation. </p>
            <p>With reference to some commercial shellfish species, overexploitation is tied directly to habitat
                destruction. The development of different methods of fishing to increase the catch of a declining stock
                has been disruptive. Hydraulic pumping for sea clams was once outlawed in the Bay. Over the past several
                decades, however, it has been re-implemented in an attempt to increase the harvesting of these
                clams.</p>
