                <p>Over 30 discharge facilities are located in the Cape Cod watershed. While some offer advanced
                    treatment with nutrient removal of their effluent, most are designed for only secondary
                    treatment.
                    The number of discharge facilities in combination with the slightly pervious sandy soil of the
                    Cape
                    is a potential hazard that needs to be closely monitored. Also within the watershed are 90 known
                    facilities that handle hazardous wastes, and 3 facilities with National Pollution Discharge
                    Elimination System (NPDES) permits. Although limitations and monitoring requirements are in
                    place
                    for the effluent at these facilities, a close appraisal of the effects on the surrounding
                    ecosystem
                    is warranted.</p>

                <p>Polluted runoff is another major problem on the Cape. this type of pollution is a result of
                    contaminants picked up in rainwater and melting snow which are eventually emptied into the bay.
                    Examples of possible pollutants picked up in runoff include fertilizers and other lawn/garden
                    chemicals, wastes from pets, salt from roadways, and oil and gasoline leaked from automobiles.
                    In many towns on the Cape this problem is compounded by the large parking lots located near or
                    directly adjacent to harbors. Not only are the oil and gasoline associated with parked automobiles a
                    problem, but these large parking lots are often the site of the disposal of snow (and the associated
                    salt
                    used to treat the roads) cleared from roads during the winter.</p>

                    toxic
                    effects of pollution, excessive nutrient input from both point and nonpoint sources leads to
                    high
                    levels of plant growth in the bay, better known as

                       regions of the bay.">HABs</a></p>

                <p><strong>Habitat Destruction</strong></p>

                <p>One of the most important, yet least studied habitats in Cape Cod Bay are the eelgrass
                    ecosystems. In
                    shallow areas of Cape Cod Bay, eelgrass (Zostera marina) is fundamental in structuring the
                    resident
                    flora and fauna. Eelgrass systems are highly productive and extremely important biologically.
                    They
                    act as a refuge and nursery for juvenile fish and shellfish, many of which are commercially
                    important species in this region and typically support a higher diversity and abundance of
                    marine
                    life compared to surrounding unvegetated areas (Heck et al. 1989). Seagrasses are equally
                    important
                    from a purely physical perspective in that they help to prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments
                    with their extensive root systems as well as aid in filtering contaminants from the water
                    column.</p>

                <p>Despite the obvious value of eelgrass ecosystems, eelgrass beds are threatened by a number of
                    anthropogenic perturbations. Declines in seagrass populations have been linked to physical
                    disturbances (i.e., dredging, construction, shellfishing, propeller damage from boating),
                    turbidity
                    (i.e. topsoil runoff, activities that resuspend sediments), and pollution (including
                    eutrophication). In Cape Cod Bay the destruction off eelgrass habitats by each of these
                    mechanisms
                    is evident. Hydraulic pumping by commercial sea clammers and the use of draggers fitted with
                    teeth
                    to pull out quahogs completely uproot the eelgrass plants, requiring years to recover (Neckles
                    2005). This is compounded by the damage from propellers by the powerboats that concentrate in
                    the
                    eelgrass beds of the Bay for recreational fishing. Adding the additional stress of
                    eutrophication,
                    as discussed previously, makes the health of this already fragile ecosystem even more
                    tenuous.</p>

                <p><strong>Eutrophication</strong></p>

                <p>The consequences of pollution have already manifested in the Bay. In addition to the direct,
                    toxic
                    effects of pollution, excessive nutrient input from both point and nonpoint sources leads to
                    high
                    levels of plant growth in the Bay, better known as eutrophication. Eutrophication has been
                    linked to
                    a number of different harmful processes in coastal waters, and there is evidence that
                    eutrophication
                    is already occurring in certain regions of the Bay. Two symptoms of eutrophication that have
                    been
                    extensively documented are harmful algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia.</p>

                <p><strong>Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)</strong></p>

                <p>Algal blooms occur primarily during the spring and summer in Cape Cod waters. During the spring,
                    Phaeocystis blooms occur frequently. The negative impacts of a bloom of this phytoplankton are
                    far
                    reaching, affecting the entire food chain by out-competing other beneficial species of
                    phytoplankton
                    (Roberts 2003, Tang 2003), affecting zooplankton growth and production (Tang 2001, Turner et al.
                    2002), and being a nuisance to feeding right whales (Kelly et al. 1998). A more well-known
                    species
                    of phytoplankton resulting in HABs is Alexandrium sp., one of the species behind the phenomenon
                    of
                    red tides. Red tides have been linked to the deaths of fish, whales, and humans (Anderson 1994,
                    Bushaw-Neston &#038; Sellner 1999). The occurrence of this species was particularly high in Bay
                    waters this summer, and, due to its lifecycle of dormant cysts, is likely to become a repetitive
                    occurrence if conditions remain conducive, i.e. high nutrient input, stratification
                    (Mcgillicuddy et
                    al. 2003). Although there were no documented deaths as a result of the bloom in the Bay this
                    summer,
                    the effects were still felt by the loss of income of commercial fishermen from shellfish bed
                    closures.</p>

                <p><strong>Hypoxia</strong></p>

                <p>Closer inshore, the negative impacts of pollution are evident in the sediments. Sediments in and
                    around harbors such as Rock Harbor and Wellfleet Harbor, which were once sandy, are now composed
                    primarily of a silty, dark mud. If disturbed, these sediments release a distinct sulfurous odor
                    indicative of areas of low oxygen. This odor comes from the production of hydrogen sulfide by
                    bacteria which reside in low oxygen (hypoxic) sediments. Since most organisms are stressed by
                    low
                    oxygen levels, hypoxic waters are usually devoid of most life. While motile organisms such as
                    fish
                    can leave these areas, benthic organisms will be killed. This had occurred in areas of
                    Chesapeake
                    Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, giving these areas the name &#8220;dead zones.&#8221; Although
                    hypoxic
                    areas of Cape Cod Bay are not nearly as extensive as observed in these locations, these areas
                    need
                    to be monitored and remedied before the problem progresses.</p>

                <p><strong>Overexploitation</strong></p>

                <p>This region of Massachusetts was given the name of Cape Cod because of its abundance of codfish.
                    Today these fish have virtually disappeared from the waters of the Bay. Other species such as
                    flounder, tautaug, sea bass, and, most notable, striped bass have likewise suffered from
                    overexploitation. In the early days, charter captains could guarantee their customers a catch.
                    Now a
                    common saying is &#8220;That&#8217;s why they call it fishing and not catching.&#8221; The
                    apparent,
                    recent recovery of the striped bass fishery is a result of the close monitoring of this species
                    implemented by the state. Unfortunately, this recovery is a unique case and has not occurred
                    with
                    other commercial species. It is now the poignant prediction of fishermen that the bluefish will
                    be
                    the next population to crash in the Bay.</p>

                <p>With reference to some commercial shellfish species, overexploitation is tied directly to habitat
                    destruction. The development of different methods of fishing to increase the catch of a
                    declining
                    stock has been disruptive. Hydraulic pumping for sea clams was once outlawed in the Bay. Over
                    the
                    past decade, however, it has been re-implemented in an attempt to increase the harvesting of
                    these
                    clams.</p>

                                    volts, which, technically, is the potential energy difference between two points
                                    that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it
                                    (don’t panic if this makes no sense, all will be explained). The unit “volt” is
                                    named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who invented what is considered
                                    the first chemical battery. Voltage is represented in equations and schematics by
                                    the letter “V”.

                                    When describing voltage, current, and resistance, a common analogy is a water tank.
                                    In this analogy, charge is represented by the water amount, voltage is represented
                                    by the water pressure, and current is represented by the water flow. So for this
